# Book ISBN s
This project uses the openlibrary API.
Users can search for a booked by ISBN query. 

The information recieved from the API is filtered and displayed. Additinally, the book can be added to 'reading list'.
I included a local storage feature to allow the reading list to be saved

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript I started this project by setting up my HTML template. I then started with my JavaScript and had to check to see what data I was receiving from the API so that I could choose what I wanted to use for my book.
